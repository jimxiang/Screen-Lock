# Screen-Lock

###Screen lock demo main idea: 
 - Demo is consisting of four circles.   
 - You can click each circle by several times.   
 - You can set each circle's click times to generate the unlock pattern.   
 - For example, you set the four circle's unlock pattern is '2, 3, 1, 4', which means you need click the first circle 2 times, the second circle 3 tiems, the third circle 1 time and the forth circle 4 times to unlock the screen.

###How to view the doem
